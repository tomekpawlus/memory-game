Task for Motorola Solutions

Hello,

  my name is Tomek. I have finished master degree on the faculty of Architecture and Urbanism 
after that for couple of years I was working in Stockholm, Cracow and Warsaw in different 
architectural offices looking for my dream job.
  
  But... I really love thinkig, solving problems, looking for different solutions. I also love 
technology since I remember and probably what is the most important for me, I love learning new 
things and discovering new feautures. Unfortunetely architecture not gives me the pleasure of 
doing these things.

  So I thought, if not now, then will never be good time for a change. At the beginnig of this 
year I decided to move out from Warsaw to my home village and devote all my time for learning.
And I will do until I'll be good enough to start working as a software developer in my dream job. 
I am really hard-working and stabborn person, but also very humble and aware of how much I have 
to learn and how much I don't know - but it is very exciting. 

Thank you for giving me opportunity to take part in this challenge. It was great fun.

Kind regards, Tomek.
